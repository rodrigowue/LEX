# spice-arc-extractor
CMOS SPICE ARC EXTRACTOR <br>
[UNDER DEVELOPMENT] <br>

This tool is ment to extract arcs from pdn and pun networks while analysing a node-graph representation.

To run:

g++ main.cpp stlGraph.cpp transistor.cpp

./a.out <spice file>


Maybe it could become a part of an open-source characterization tool in the future.
